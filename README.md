# ValheimLib - A library to facilitate valheim modding

## About

ValheimLib is a modding framework for other mods to work in, providing centralized and simplified APIs for Valheim. 

This helps keeping mods compatible with each other.

At it's core, ValheimLib should not change how the game behaves without any other mod installed.

## Installation

The contents of `ValheimLib` should be extracted into the `BepInEx` folder, such that the ValheimLib folder in `plugins` in the archive is inside your `plugins` folder of your BepInEx installation.

Make sure that you have also installed the [HookGenPatcher](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/HookGenPatcher/). This tool generates the MMHOOK files that ValheimLib needs to function properly.

## Developing

For mod developers that wish to use ValheimLib on their plugin.

- Download this release, make sure to follow the installation instructions above, and add the ValheimLib.dll as an assembly reference in your visual studio project.

- Add the `BepInDependency` attribute top of your class that is heriting from `BaseUnityPlugin`, like so :

`[BepInDependency(ValheimLib.ValheimLib.ModGuid)]`

We also have an [ExampleMod](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/ExampleMod) visual studio project that showcase some features of ValheimLib.

Documentation will be included in the  *xmldocs*, and further information may be on the dedicated [ValheimModding wiki](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Wiki/wiki). Do not hesitate to ask in [the modding discord](https://discord.gg/RBq2mzeu4z) too!
